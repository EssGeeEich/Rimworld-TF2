# Rimworld-TF2
TF2 Presets for Rimworld - to be used with EDB Prepare Carefully

Each of the 9 mercenaries has a behavior, a backstory and skills of his own based on the TF2 lore/comics!
Some exceptions have been made in order to keep some game balance.

Comes in three flavours:
- **TF2 - Basic Weapons** has all 9 characters spawn at once with basic weapons;
- **TF2 - Good Weapons** has all 9 characters spawn at once with their own weapons;
- **TF2 - Rimworld Friendly** has only 5 characters spawn at once, and the other 4 will be found in the world.
